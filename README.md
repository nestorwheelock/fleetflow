## The Problem

You're running a car rental business with 10-50 vehicles. You need software that:
- Prevents double-bookings
- Lets customers book online
- Tracks maintenance
- Generates contracts
- Actually fits your budget

**But your options are:**
- Enterprise software at $500-1,000/month (overkill)
- Spreadsheets and sticky notes (chaos)
- Generic booking tools (not built for rentals)

---
